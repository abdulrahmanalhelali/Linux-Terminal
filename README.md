In this project I tried to copy the linux terminal. You can use commands you would normally use in linux terminal here like: "ls", "cd", "mkdir", but I added a few extra like: "mkfile", and "lsrec". So like "mkdir" where it usually creates a new folder, "mkfile" creates a new text file for you. Then like "ls" where it shows you all the files and folders in that specific folder, "lsrec" shows you all the files and folders from the root directory all the way down.
